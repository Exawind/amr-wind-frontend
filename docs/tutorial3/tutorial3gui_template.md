## Introduction

This tutorial will demonstrate the following features: 
- How to set up a wind farm layout with multiple turbines using
  `amrwind-frontend`.
- How to run a parameter sweep over wind speed and wind direction, and
  have `amrwind-frontend` generate the necessary input files for each
  case.
<!--INTROTEXT1-->

<!--WINDPROPSTART-->
## Set some wind properties

For the purposes of demonstrating how to setup a wind farm layout,
we'll start with some arbitrary wind speed and wind direction values.
The exact values don't really matter, as later on in the tutorial,
we'll change these values, but for now they'll be useful when plotting
the results.

Below we'll use a wind speed of {WS} m/s and wind direction of {WDir}
degrees.
<!--WINDPROPEND-->

In the **ABL** tab, set the following inputs according to this table:

| Input                   | Value      |
| ---                     | ---        |
| Use speed & dir instead | {useWSDir} |
| Wind speed              | {WS}       |
| Wind direction          | {WDir}     |

The input field should look similar to:  

![{img_ABL_settings}]({img_ABL_settings})

Then hit the **[Calc WS/WDir]** button, and it should fill in the
values of the Wind Vector appropriately.

## Create wind farm layout and domain

The first thing to do in setting the wind farm layout is to set the
location of each of the turbines. Click on the **Farm** tab, and hit
**[show]** next to **Wind farm turbine layout**.

Copy and paste this input into the **CSV Contents** window.
```
{turbinescsv}
```

If you have all of the turbine inputs in a separate CSV file, you can
also load them by hitting **[Choose file]**, then selecting the file,
and hitting **[Load/Reload]**.

The other inputs in the
| Input                    | value              |
| ---                      | ---                |
| Farm domain size (X,Y,Z) | {domainsize}       |
| Background mesh size [m] | {backgrounddeltax} |

![{img_farm_turbine_layout}]({img_farm_turbine_layout})

If you have questions about what each of the columns in the CSV input
mean, hit the **[?]** button.  You should see a help window that
resembles:

{turbinecsv_help}

Press the **[Preview]** button under **Actions**.  It should generate
a turbine and domain layout image which resembles something like this:  

![{img_turbine_layout_preview}]({img_turbine_layout_preview})

There should be two turbines labeled T1 and T0 in the middle of a 1 km
x 1 km domain.

If you want to adjust any turbine positions or orientations, go back
and edit the CSV input above.  Then press the **[Create turbines]**
button to actually create the turbines in the simulation.

To verify that the turbines are actually created, click the
**Turbines** tab and then look at the **Turbine List** under **Add
turbines here**.  You should see that both T0 and T1 are included in
the list:

![{img_farm_turbine_created}]({img_farm_turbine_created})


## Create wind farm refinement zones  

Now around each turbine, we'll add some refinement zones so the
turbine rotors can be resolved.  Click back on the **Farm** tab, and
hit **[show]** next to **Farm refinement zones**.

```
{refinementcsv}
```

![{img_farm_refinementspec}]({img_farm_refinementspec})

If you have questions about what each of the CSV columns are supposed
to mean, hit the **[?]** button.  You should see a help window with
the following information:

{refinecsv_help}

Press the **[Create refinements]** button to ceate the refinement
zones.  Then, to see what the refinement zones look like, open the
plot domain dialog on the menu bar: **Plot**-->**Plot domain**.  You
should see that there 4 refinement zones present, and the two
previously created turbines also present.  

![{img_plotDomainWin_refinezone}]({img_plotDomainWin_refinezone})

Hit **[Select all]** for both the refinement zones and turbines, then
press **[Plot Domain]**.  You should see both turbines plotted, and
each refinement level around the turbines shown.  Everything should be
oriented so that it points into the wind:

![{img_plotDomainFig_refineturbine}]({img_plotDomainFig_refineturbine})

## Create sampling planes

```
{samplingcsv}
```

![{img_farm_samplingspec}]({img_farm_samplingspec})

{samplingcsv_help}

![{img_plotDomainWin_samplingzone}]({img_plotDomainWin_samplingzone})

![{img_plotDomainFig_refineturbinesampling}]({img_plotDomainFig_refineturbinesampling})

## See the output 

To see what the AMR-Wind input file would look like, you can go to the
menu bar, select **Run** --> **Preview Input File**, to see the
preview window (you can also just hit **File** --> **Save input file
as** to save it to a file).

The input file should look similar to:  
<details>
  <summary>[input file]</summary>
<pre>
{amrwindinput1}
</pre>
</details>

## Set up a wind sweep

The above instructions were to set up a single case with one wind
speed ({WS} m/s) and one wind direction ({WDir}) degrees.  Now we'll
show what happens when you want to vary these to run a parameter
sweep.  Hit **[show]** next to **Run parameter sweep**, and put in the
following inputs:

| Input                 | Value              |
| ---                   | ---                |
| Wind speeds           | {sweep_windspeeds} |
| Wind directions       | {sweep_winddirs}   |
| Case prefix           | {caseprefix}       |
| New dir for each case | {usenewdirs}       |
| Logfile               | {logfile}          |

The set up should be similar to: 

![{img_farm_runsweepspec}]({img_farm_runsweepspec})

Then hit the **[Create cases]** button.  Four input files should be generated:
```
Tutorial3_Case_0.inp
Tutorial3_Case_1.inp
Tutorial3_Case_2.inp
Tutorial3_Case_3.inp
```
as well as the yaml log file [`{logfile}`]({logfile}) which should look similar to this:  

```yaml
{logfileoutput}
```

## Save the wind farm setup

After doing all of this wind farm setup work, we can save all of these
settings so that they can be reloaded and modified for future use.

At the top of the farm tab, expand the **Options** field and put in
the following inputs:

| Input           | Value               |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Farm setup file | {farm_setupfile}    |
| User comments   | {farm_usercomments} |

Note that the user comments field is arbitrary.  The input fields
should look like:

![{img_farm_savefarmsetup}]({img_farm_savefarmsetup})

Then press the **[Save YAML]** button under **Actions**.  You should
see the file [`{farm_setupfile}`]({farm_setupfile}) created, which
will look similar to this:

<details>
  <summary>[{farm_setupfile}]</summary>
<pre>
{farm_setupfile_output}
</pre>
</details>

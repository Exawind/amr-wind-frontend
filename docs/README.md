## Tutorial cases

There are a couple of examples cases which demonstrate how to use
`amrwind-frontend` to set up and run turbine and ABL simulations.

- [Tutorial 1](tutorial1/README.md): Demonstrates setting up, running,
  and postprocessing an acutator disk model in uniform flow.

- [Tutorial 2](tutorial2/README.md): Setting up, running, and
  postprocessing a convectively unstable ABL case.

- [Tutorial 3](tutorial3/README.md): How to set up a wind farm case
  with many wind turbines.

## Case studies

There are a couple of case studies 

- [NREL 2.8-127 turbine
  calibration](casestudies/NREL_2p8_127/README.md): Using
  amrwind-frontend to set up an ADM run of the NREL 2.8-127, and
  comparing the performance curves.

- [SWIFT ABL run](casestudies/SWIFT/README.md): How to use
  amrwind-frontend to set up a SWIFT Neutral ABL case, and postprocess
  the results.

# Tutorial 1: Actuator Disk Turbine in Uniform Flow

This tutorial shows how to set up an actuator disk turbine model in a
uniform flow in AMR-Wind.

| Setting    | Value          |
| ---        | ---            |
| Turbine    | NREL 5MW       |
| Wind type  | Uniform inflow |
| Wind Speed | 10.0 m/s       |

There are two equivalent ways to set up the case, both should lead to
the same result:

- [Using the GUI interface](tutorial1gui.md)
- [Using the python interface](tutorial1_python.md)
